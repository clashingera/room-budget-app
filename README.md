🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
⚙️ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME

2. Set Up Firebase

Create a project at the Firebase Console.

Create a Web App within your Firebase project.

Find your Firebase configuration keys in your project settings.

3. Configure Your Keys

In the project's root directory, find the file firebase-config.example.js.

Rename it to firebase-config.js.

Open firebase-config.js and replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration keys from Step 2.

// firebase-config.js
export const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    // ...and so on
};

This firebase-config.js file is listed in .gitignore to keep your keys safe and out of the repository!

4. Run the Application
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can use a live server extension in your code editor for the best experience.
